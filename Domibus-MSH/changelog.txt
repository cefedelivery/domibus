Domibus 4.0.1
- Changes in order to improve logging for multitenancy:
    - domibus.log, business.log and security.log will contains only entries without domain information
    - a logback.xml file for 'default' domain should be added always apart from the other domains
- Add email alert support for super user login failure and account disabled.
Domibus 4.0
- Default WS Plugin: the XSD schema validation has been disabled by default due to performance reasons
- Removed unused classes:Validator<T>,NullValidator,ValidationException
- Support for email alert system
- Support for multi-tenancy
- Sample domain configuration file domain_name-domibus.properties included in the distribution.
- Management of participants through the administration console
- Removed the module domibus-ext-services-api and moved all services from domibus-ext-services-api to the plugin-api
- Security policies were updated and renamed. Sample pModes were updated to use the new policies.
  New policies are:
      eDeliveryAS4Policy.xml - Reference to a Subject Key Identifier
      eDeliveryAS4Policy_BST.xml - Reference to a Binary Security Token
      eDeliveryAS4Policy_IS.xml - Reference to an Issuer and Serial Number
  Message exchange using old and new policies is not possible in all combinations.
  Therefore, custom pModes should also be updated to the new policies. Replace eDeliveryPolicy.xml and eSensPolicy(.v2.0).xml with the new eDeliveryAS4Policy.xml.

- Fix sendAttempt counter (initial one plus number of retries defined in the pmode)
- Block the receiving of the message in case the sender's certificate is not valid or revoked.
    Two more properties were added (for more details check domibus.properties file):

- JMS monitoring: extended the functionality for clustered installations.
- Core: listPendingMessages and download operations behave correctly in case of a clustered installation.
- Core: Spring services are always executing within a transaction even if there is no specific @Transactional annotation present
- Core: Quartz integration with managed threads in WebLogic and WildFly
- Core: during sendMessage operation, Domibus verifies that the parties roles are allowed (present in PMode) and different among them.

- Core: during MSH receive operation, Domibus can verify the trust of the sender if activated.
- Core: validation on MessageId and RefToMessageId can be by-passed by removing the key "domibus.sendMessage.messageIdPattern" from configuration file.
- Core: new configuration properties added for ConnectionTimeout and ReceiveTimeout to allow fine tuning of the access points' conduit.
