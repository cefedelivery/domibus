Domibus 3.3-RC1
- Add the posibility to pull messages
- Expose the DOWNLOADED message status in the plugin API and the default ws plugin

- Migrated the logging framework to SLF4J and Logback
- Domibus uses 3 logs files: domibus.log, domibus-business.log and domibus-security.log
- JMS monitoring: fixed the computation of the total number of messages in the queue for WebLogic
- JMS monitoring: fixed the search of the JMS messages for WebLogic(for JMS messages having property with null values) and Tomcat(for JMS messages with no "Text" property)
- JMS monitoring: extended the functionality for clustered installations.
- Core: listPendingMessages and download operations behave correctly in case of a clustered installation.
- Core: Spring services are always executing within a transaction even if there is no specific @Transactional annotation present
- Core: Quartz integration with managed threads in WebLogic and WildFly
- Core: during sendMessage operation, Domibus verifies that the parties roles are allowed (present in PMode) and different among them.
- Core: during sendMessage operation, Domibus verifies that the message is being sent by the same party as the one configured as the sending access point.
- Core: during sendMessage operation, Domibus trims the leading and trailing whitespaces in all the request fields.
- Core: during sendMessage operation, Domibus verifies that, if MessageId and RefToMessageId is specified by backend client, then it should contain only printable ASCII characters.
- Core: during sendMessage operation, all validations comparisons with the PMode data are case insensitive.
- Core: during MSH dispatch operation, Domibus verifies the validity of sender's certificate.
- Core: during MSH receive operation, Domibus verifies the trust of the sender.
- Core: validation on MessageId and RefToMessageId can be by-passed by removing the key "domibus.sendMessage.messageIdPattern" from configuration file.
- Core: new configuration properties added for ConnectionTimeout and ReceiveTimeout to allow fine tuning of the access points' conduit.
- Core: provision added to support the "DoNothing security" policy (no security, no encryption).
- Core+Plugins: added the DOWNLOADED status to message state workflow. This new status is also visible through the console.
- DB: MySQL installation of Domibus database is set to have collation of 'UTF8_BIN' to make DB level string comparison (in SQLs) case sensitive. This will enable support for case sensitive message ids.
- WS Plugin: the response list of ListPendingMessages operation can be limited using a new configuration property (domibus.listPendingMessages.maxCount).
- Config: increased the value of the retry tolerance to 3 hours
- Config: added new property "domibus.sendMessage.failure.delete.payload" to enable/disable the removal of the message payload on send failure.
