Scripts for creation of a Domibus-3.2 image on the Fiware Lab. 

Desired name for the new image: Domibus-3.2
Base image: base_ubuntu_14.04
Required flavor: m1.medium
Port 8080 has to be opened externally.

Create script: ./create.sh
Data: data.tgz (expected in the same folder as create.sh)
Test script: ./test.sh

The creation script:
	- installs mysql on default port 3306
	- creates domibus db and edelivery user
	- creates domibus tables
	- installs Domibus 3.2 on Tomcat 8
	- installs certificates for "ceftestparty8gw" to connect to the Connectivity Test Platform (http://40.115.23.114:8080/domibus/services/msh)
	- starts Domibus and waits for the service to become available
	- uploads the pMode with parties "ceftestparty8gw" and "cefsupportgw"
	
The testing script performs a sanity check that the service is available on http://localhost:8080/domibus/home

Data (data.tgz) contains:
	- private key: ceftestparty8gwkeystore.jks
	- public key: ceftestparty8gwtruststore.jks
	- pMode file: domibus-ceftestparty8gw-pmode.xml

Testing the resulted instance

The instance is already configured to be able to send messages to the Connectivity Test Platform.

A SoapUI project is available to help you test the sending of messages using this instance. The steps are:

• open SoapUI and import the project (File->Import->browse to AS4ConnectivitySoapTest-soapui-project_gw8.xml)
• open AS4ConnectivitySoapTest->BackendService_1_1SoapBinding->SendMessage->Request 1
• click on the green button to send a message; the result will be a unique messageID
• in the browser, go to http://<your_ip>:8080/domibus/home to check your message was ACKNOWLEDGED
